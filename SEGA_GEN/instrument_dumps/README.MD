This folder contains dumps of FM Synthesis settings for various popular Sega Genesis games. Particularly those that have distinct sounds including Sonic 1 (Iconic Sounds), Sonic and Knuckles, Toejam and Earl (Funky Hip Hop), Battle Mania Daiginjou (Hard Guitar Rock), Golden Axe (Medevial), Togi O: King Colossus (Orchestral). You should be able to import them into Deflemask. Unfortunately the game name does not come with the dump, so you'll have to experiment or google soundtrack names. vgm2pre convertor exe is also here as I fear it will one day disappear from the web.
