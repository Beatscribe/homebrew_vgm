For use with GBT Player driver.
Since GBT player doesn't have a note cut (that I'm aware of - correct me if I'm wrong) I can't do the 2xx KICK beats and then cut it like you hear in the .xm and .uge versions. The Four to the Floor version has a template with kicks and rave-like bass notes in between to circumvent this issue.
